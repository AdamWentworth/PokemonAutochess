# 🧩 Pokemon Autochess

A **custom 3D game engine** and prototype auto-battler inspired by chess, real-time tactics, and the Pokémon universe.

Built in **C++17** using modern rendering, math, and architecture techniques — from scratch.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This engine is hand-built with modern C++ and real-time rendering in mind:

- **SDL2** – windowing, input, and OpenGL context creation
- **OpenGL 3.3 Core** – GPU-based real-time rendering
- **GLAD** – OpenGL function loader
- **GLSL** – vertex/fragment shaders
- **GLM** – matrix/vector math (camera, transforms)
- **CMake** – cross-platform build system
- **vcpkg** – dependency management

### 🧩 Planned Integrations

- **EnTT** – ECS architecture for game logic
- **Assimp** – 3D model loading (FBX, OBJ, etc)
- **Lua** – scripting support for units/AI
- **ImGui** – debug tools and UI
- **Bullet3** – physics (collisions, movement)

---

## 🎮 Game Concept

> Think **Teamfight Tactics** meets Pokémon, in a stylized 3D grid world.

- Players draft Pokémon and position them on a chessboard-like arena.
- Combat is automatic, based on positioning, abilities, and synergies.
- Strategy comes from placement, team composition, and ability timing.

### 🔭 Visual Style

- Fixed top-down / isometric camera (TFT-like)
- Stylized models and animations
- Vibrant battlefield with dynamic effects

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- **CMake** 3.21+ (tested with 4.0.2)
- **Visual Studio 2022** with C++ development tools
- **vcpkg** installed locally (not globally)
- Environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` pointing to your vcpkg directory

---

### 📦 Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/PokemonAutochess.git
cd PokemonAutochess

# Clone vcpkg (alongside or in a known location)
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:/dev/vcpkg
cd C:/dev/vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

---

### 📁 Set VCPKG_ROOT (once)

Make sure CMake knows where vcpkg is located by setting `VCPKG_ROOT`.

> After this, restart your terminal or VS Code to ensure it's picked up.

---

### 📦 Install Dependencies

Install all required libraries using vcpkg:

```bash
# From the vcpkg directory
./vcpkg install sdl2 sdl2-ttf glad glm lua
```

---

### 🏗️ Build the Project

```bash
cd C:/Code/PokemonAutochess

# Optional: clean previous cache
rmdir /s /q build

# Configure the project (MSVC + vcpkg toolchain)
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -S . -B build

# Build it
cmake --build build --config Debug
```

---

### ▶️ Run the Game

```bash
.\build\Debug\PokemonAutochess.exe
```

Or open the solution file in Visual Studio and press **F5**:

```bash
build/PokemonAutochess.sln
```

---

### ✅ Optional VS Code Integration

To use VS Code to build and debug:

1. Open Command Palette → `CMake: Select a Kit`
2. Choose: **Visual Studio 17 2022 Release - x64**
3. Run: `CMake: Configure` and then `CMake: Build`

---

You're now ready to build, run, and extend the game engine and prototype. Enjoy developing Pokémon Autochess! 🎮

## 🌀 Gameplay Flow & Round System

The game takes place in **Kanto**, combining elements of classic Pokémon progression with auto-battler mechanics similar to *Auto Chess* and *Teamfight Tactics*.

### 🎬 Game Start: Starter Selection

- Players begin in **Pallet Town** by choosing a starter: **Bulbasaur**, **Charmander**, or **Squirtle**.
- This is a **free round** with no combat — a chance to set your initial direction.
- The starter is your foundation, but early opportunities exist to pivot or evolve depending on unit offerings.

### 🔄 Round Progression

Rounds represent different Kanto locations or encounters. Each round offers a new challenge, unit choices, or key battles:

| Round | Location / Theme       | Encounter Type       | Notes |
|-------|------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 1     | Pallet Town            | Starter Selection    | Free round – pick your starter |
| 2–3   | Route 1                | PvE: Wild Pokémon     | Early units, some synergy seeds |
| 4     | Viridian City          | PvE + Shop            | Item drops + expanded shop pool |
| 5     | Viridian Forest        | PvE: Swarm battle     | Status effects, type counters |
| 6     | Route 22 (optional)    | PvE or PvP variant    | Chance to pivot, strong wilds |
| 7     | Pewter City            | **Boss: Gym Leader** | Battle against **Brock** and his themed team |

Future rounds will follow this pattern: **travel → encounter → evolve/upgrade → major battle**.

### 🧠 Synergy System (Early Concept)

Like TFT or Auto Chess, Pokémon will gain bonuses based on shared traits — but beyond types.

#### Planned synergy categories

- **Type Synergy** – Traditional (e.g. Fire, Water, Grass). Grants team bonuses.
- **Origin Synergy** – Based on where/how the Pokémon was acquired (starter, route, gym leader, etc).
- **Evolution Chains** – Owning connected evolutions (e.g. Charmander + Charmeleon) provides bonuses.
- **Role Synergy** – Broad tactical categories like:
  - **Tanks** – High HP/defense
  - **Speedsters** – Fast attack animations or movement
  - **Status Masters** – Use paralysis, sleep, poison, etc.
  - **Glass Cannons** – High burst damage, low durability

These synergies influence unit stats, ability cooldowns, and team-wide effects.

More details will be added as we build out the round engine, combat loop, and draft/shop systems.

## Trace gating via environment variables

This patch removes the hard-coded Bulbasaur/Vine Whip trace gating and switches to the same env-driven matching rules implemented in `src/game/logging/DebugTrace.h`.

### Environment variables

- `PAC_TRACE_ALL=1`  
  Enables all combat traces.

- `PAC_TRACE_COMBAT="unit:move,unit2:move2"`  
  Comma/semicolon/whitespace-separated tokens.  
  Each token is `unit:move` where either side may be `*` (wildcard).  
  If a token has no `:`, it is treated as a unit-only match (`move="*"`).

### Examples

- `PAC_TRACE_COMBAT="bulbasaur:vine_whip"`
- `PAC_TRACE_COMBAT="*:vine_whip"`
- `PAC_TRACE_COMBAT="bulbasaur:*"`
- `PAC_TRACE_COMBAT="*:*,pikachu:thunder_shock"`

### Files included

- `scripts/systems/combat.lua`  
  Lua-side `emit()` debug prints gated by `PAC_TRACE_ALL` / `PAC_TRACE_COMBAT`.

- `src/game/GameWorld.cpp`  
  Animation tick / clamp logs gated by `DebugTrace::combat(unit, move)`.

- `src/game/scripting/LuaBindings.cpp`  
  `world_apply_damage` tracing gated by `DebugTrace::combat(unit, move)`.

### Notes

- Log prefixes were renamed from `[VW_*]` to `[TRACE_*]` so they aren’t misleading when tracing other units/moves.
- These files assume `DebugTrace.h` remains at `src/game/logging/DebugTrace.h` and is included via:
  - `"logging/DebugTrace.h"` in `GameWorld.cpp`
  - `"game/logging/DebugTrace.h"` in `LuaBindings.cpp`  
  (matching existing include conventions in those files).
